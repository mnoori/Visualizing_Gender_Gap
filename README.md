# Visualizing_Gender_Gap
The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website. You can download the dataset Randal compiled here: http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv

Randal compiled this data set to explore the gender gap in STEM fields, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This gap is reported on often in the news and not everyone agrees that there is a gap.

In this project, we'll explore how we can communicate the nuanced narrative of gender gap using effective data visualization.
